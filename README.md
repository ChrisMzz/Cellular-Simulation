# Cellular Simulation

Hello ! This repository will be the scape goat of any experimentation I want to make with [`Pillow`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), on a pixel simulation project, based off of an image of [NMuMG](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54930849) cells that I used for another project.

The point of the simulation is the try and make an evolving image with near-unpredictable long-term behaviour.
Of course, it's not unpredictable in the slightest, but data can be extracted from an image in the generated `gif` sequence randomly enough to be used in other projects, and that's what I'll focus on as it's, pratically speaking, the least wasteful way of spending time doing research for this.

## How it works

### More

Along with chaotic noise-like behaviour and other types of movement, here's an example of what to expect :
